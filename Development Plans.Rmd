I met with Jack Kent, Deborah Newman, and Charles Peterson about how to use
genetic data in a gene dropping simulation.

Jack, Debbie, and Charles,

Thank you for meeting with me. I appreciate your help in clarifying the 
various stages of the issues associated with providing genetic management 
guidance via simulation with partially known MHC data. 

1. I will look more closely into what will be needed to add genetic 
information and gene frequency information into the gene dropping routines 
in the kinship2 package. The initial implementation will use only a single 
locus, which should be a sufficient for MHC data

	A. First step will be to ensure we get expected proportions of genes in 
	children of individuals when we provide genetic data to all founders using 
	a gene frequency based algorithm.

	B. Second step will be to ensure we get expected proportions of genes in 
	children when all parental generations have fully known genotypes.

	C. Third step will be to ensure we get expected proportions of genes in 
	children when parental generations have partially known genotypes and all 
	other genotypes are uninformative.

	D. Fourth step will be to ensure we get expected proportions of genes in 
	children when parental generations have partially known genotypes and 
	remaining parental genes are determined by gene frequency.

2. We will not worry about getting rid of genes in the pedigrees since colony 
managers need only not breed animals that carry unwanted alleles.

3. I will produce a small number of pedigree drawings using the data Debbie 
has provided to get feedback on preferences and additional requirements.

4. I will not deal with paternity and maternity issues within the pedigrees 
at this time.

Thanks again.
