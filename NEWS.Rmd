# nprcmanager 0.4.17 (20181208)
-   Changed error reporting so as not to report as an error the wrong sex when 
    animals are added into the pedigree
    and appear as both a sire and dam without an ego record. 
    The error report now indicates these are both a sire and a dam. Done 20181208
-   Made a combined logo for Oregon and SNPRC. Have ONPRC on top using blue and
    green. Done 20181208
-   Additional unit 
    tests to cover all of the new functions created to handle the PEDSYS and
    military formated dates (YYYYMMDD) have been made. Done 20181112
-   Corrected breeding groups formation, which was including unknown animals that 
    had been added as placeholders for unknown parents. Done 20181119
-   Hardened LabKey code by trapping a bad base URL in the configuration file
    with a tryCatch function and send a message to the log file. This needs to be
    tested with a working LabKey system.
