	<h3><b>Summary Statistics</b></h3>
	After running a Genetic Value Analysis, this page
	will contain summary statistics and histograms for
	the population under consideration.
	<br>
	<b>Note:</b> Founder equivalents and founder genome
	equivalents will be inflated due to partial parentage
	information. Calculating these statistics necessitates
	adding placeholder IDs to fill out partial parentage
	information. Each placeholder ID used is treated as
	a founder. Calculations of <em>f<sub>e</sub></em> and
	<em>f<sub>g</sub></em> may be changed at some point
	in the future to try to correct for this situation.

	<b>Founder Equivalents:</b>
	<br>
	Founder equivalents estimates the expected number
	of equally contributing founders that would be
	required to produce the observed genetic diversity
	in the current population.

	Where p<sub>i</sub> is the proportion of the genes of the living,
	descendant population contributed by founder i.

	<b>Founder Genome Equivalents:</b>
	<br>
	Founder genome equivalents estimates the expected number of
	equally contributing founders that would be required to 
	produce the observed genetic diversity in the current
	population if no alleles had been lost to drift.

<p style="padding-left: 50px; padding-bottom: 15px">
	f<sub>g</sub> = 1 / &Sigma;(p<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>/r<sub>i</sub>)
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 15px">
	Where p<sub>i</sub> is the proportion of the genes of the living,
	descendant population contributed by founder i, and r<sub>i</sub>
	is the allelic retention for founder i (estimated by gene drop).
