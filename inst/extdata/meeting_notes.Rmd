## 20180711 Meeting Notes

### Summary Statistics tab

1. Use default box and whisker plot with red dots for outliers.
    a. Changes made 2018-07-14
    b. Hover text to box and whisker plots added 2018-07-14

### Pedigree Browser tab
1. Change Update breeding colony button to "" Waiting on Amanda.
2. Add function to "Update Breeding Colony" button to browse for a file; add animal IDs to the window where they could be pasted.
3. Change first bullet point to reflect change in function of the "Update Breeding Colony" button
4. Move first bullet point to far right.
5. Remove second bullet point. However, provide this information when the file has any type of error. 
6. Change "Display UIDs for partial parentage" to "Display UIDs". Consider coming up with a better name than "UID". Add hovertext to explain what this button does. Proposed explanatory text: "UIDs are created by the application for all animals with only one parent."
7. Change "Trim pedigree based on specified population" to "Trim Pedigree". Add hovertext to explain what this button does. See what "Trim Pedigree" button does. Does it remove animals? Its intent is to reduce the number of animals being examined. Does it change genetic analysis. The name of this button will likely follow from what the new name for "Update Breeing Colony" button.
8. Add a better description for the Search field.

### Error Handling
1. Develop a full set of error messages appropriate for all types of input files.
    a. Added improved error detection and reporting for missing required columns - 201807-17
2. Amanda and Beth will provide me with some files with errors.
   a. Beth provided a file with two error types: bad birth date type - integer instead of character representation of a date and animal appearing as a sire and a dam. 
   b. Both errors were caught, but the first error was only seen after correcting the first. It would be better to report all errors and set a flag that told the program to stop at the end of parsing the entire pedigree.
3. Refactored some code within __qcStudbook__ to a separate function __unknown2NA__. 2018-07-18

### Multiple tabs
1. Come up with a different word for "Breeders". What do you think about _Managed Animals_
  a. Amanda suggested _Focal Animals_ -- this was adopted.

### Miscellaneous items

    a. 2018-07-17 first draft
    b. Need to first move content that has been prepared to the correct location
2. Changed read.csv to read.table in code to emphasize we are able to read multiple file types.
    a. 2018-07-17
3. Amended documentation for the __addGenotype__ function to indicate that it is assuming 
the _genotype_ object was opened by __checkGenotypeFile__.
