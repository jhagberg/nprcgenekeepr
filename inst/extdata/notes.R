#' Notes file containing plans, thoughts and speculations.
#'
#' 1. Add a age-sex pyramide plot to learn how to use the shiny interface
#' conventions currently in use. --- Done
#' 2. Add the ability to detect where it is so that ONPRC or SNPRC logos and
#' tabs are displayed appropriately. --- Done
#' 3. Add ability to pull data directly from LabKey --- Done for SNPRC
#' 4. Integrate the shiny application with LabKey.
#' 5. Add breeding productivity measure calculations. For example, (a) number of
#' offspring per year of exposure to male or female. (b) Number of months since
#' last birth. (c) Number of months between births with range and standard
#' deviation.
#' 6. Add ability to have commas or semicolons between IDs in filter for Genetic
#' Value Analysis output table. --- Done
#' 7. Fix layout of "Enter the number of simulations for the gene-drop analysis:"
#' and "Enter the genome uniqueness threshold:" so that they are level with each
#' other.
#' 8. Should "unique" be change to "rare" or "infrequent" since more than one
#' individual may carry the gene?
