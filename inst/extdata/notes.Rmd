Notes file containing plans, thoughts and speculations.

1. Integrate the shiny application with LabKey.

2. Add breeding productivity measure calculations. For example, (a) number of
offspring per year of exposure to male or female. (b) Number of months since
last birth. (c) Number of months between births with range and standard
deviation.

3. Fix layout of "Enter the number of simulations for the gene-drop analysis:"
and "Enter the genome uniqueness threshold:" so that they are level with each
other.

4. Develop a simulation module to allow uses to simulate breeding decisions.
    a. Need to be able to set the following values.
        a. Number desired males produced each year
        b. Frequency of matings that produce offspring that can successfully breed
        c. Number of animals of each sex and age removed from breeding each year. 
        This would not necessarily be constant, it could be a list with sublist for each year.
        d. Ability to choose among various mating strategies based on age, mean kinship,
        e. Practical numbers of each sex in a breeding group
        f. Percent of year needed to adapt to new mating structure after a change.
        g. Loss due to mortality rate by age and sex
        h. Ability to use historical data for mating success
    b. Breeding methods based on mean kinship (MK)
        a. Static MK
            a. At each timestep, all individual MKs for animals of breeding age
            are calculated and 2 sex-specific lists 
            created that rank individuals from lowest MKs to highest.
            b. Breeding groups are formed with breeding pairs having to have a kinship
            coefficient (_f_) less than the average _f_ in the population to avoid
            close inbreeding. When a pair is rejected, remaining females, running from
            lowest MK to highest become the next potential mates. 
            If a suitable female is not found, that male is removed from the pool of
            potential breeders and an attempt is made to pair the next lowest MK male 
            with the MK list of females.
            c. Offspring are simulated and stored.
         b. See jhered.esr129.full.pdf page 188 for other breeding strategies.
