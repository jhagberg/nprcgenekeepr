Description: The goal of 'nprcmanager' is to implement Genetic Tools for Colony 
    Management and is a derivation of the work in Amanda Vinson and Michael J 
    Raboin (2015) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4671785/>
    "A Practical Approach for Designing Breeding Groups to Maximize Genetic 
    Diversity in a Large Colony of Captive Rhesus Macaques ('Macaca mulatto')".
    It provides a Shiny application with an exposed API. 
    The application supports five groups of functions: (1) Quality control of 
    studbooks contained in text files or Excel workbooks and of pedigrees within
    'LabKey' Electronic Health Records ('EHR'); (2) Creation of pedigrees from a 
    lists of animals using the 'LabKey' 'EHR' integration; (3) Creation and 
    display of an age by sex pyramid plot of the living animals within the 
    designated pedigree; (4) Generation of Genetic Value Analysis Reports; and 
    (5) Creation of potential breeding groups with and without proscribed sex 
    ratios and defined maximum kinships.
