Description: The goal of nprcmanager is to implement Genetic Tools for Colony 
    Management. It provides a Shiny application with exposed functions.
    At present, the application supports 5 functions: (1) Quality control of 
    studbooks contained in text files or Excel workbooks and of pedigrees within
    LabKey Electronic Health Records (EHR); (2) Creation of pedigrees from a 
    lists of animals using the LabKey EHR integration; (3) Creation and display 
    of an age by sex pyramid plot of the living animals within the designated 
    pedigree; (4) Generation of Genetic Value Analysis Reports; and (5) Creation
    of potential breeding groups with and without proscribed sex ratios and 
    defined maximum kinships. The gene dropping method from "Pedigree analysis 
    by computer simulation" by Jean W Maccluer, John L Vandeberg, and Oliver A 
    Ryder (1986) <doi:10.1002/zoo.1430050209> is used in the genetic value 
    calculations and the kinship coefficients are calculated by the method 
    found in the book "Mathematical and Statistical Methods for Genetic 
    Analysis" by Kenneth Lange (2002) <doi:10.1007/978-0-387-21750-5>.
