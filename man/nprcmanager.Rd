Primary Data Structure --- Pedigree

Contains studbook information for a number of individuals.
ASSUME: All IDs listed in the sire or dam columns must have a row entry in
  the id column

A Pedigree is a data.frame with the following columns:
The possible columns are as follows:
\itemize{
\item{id} {-- character vector with unique identifier for an individual}
\item{sire} {-- character vector with unique identifier for an
individual's father (\code{NA} if unknown).}
\item{dam} {-- character vector with unique identifier for an
individual's mother (\code{NA} if unknown).}
\item{sex} {-- factor {levels: "M", "F", "U"} Sex specifier for an individual}
\item{gen} {-- integer vector with the generation number of the individual}
\item{birth} {-- Date or \code{NA} (optional) with the individual's birth date}
\item{exit} {-- Date or \code{NA} (optional) with the individual's exit date (death,
 or departure if applicable)}
\item{ancestry} {-- character vector or \code{NA} (optional) that indicates
the geographic population to which the individual belongs.}
\item{age} {-- numeric or \code{NA} (optional) indicating the individual's
current age or age at exit.}
\item{population} {-- logical (optional)
Is the id part of the extant population?}
\item{origin} {-- character vector or \code{NA} (optional) that indicates
the name of the facility that the individual was imported from.
\code{NA} indicates the invidual was not imported.}
\item{origin} {-- Facility an individual originated from, if other than local}}

Genetic Value Analysis Functions

\itemize{
\item{\link{meanKinship}} {--- Calculates the mean kinship for each animal in a
kinship matrix}
\item {\link{calcA}} {--- Calculates \code{a}, the number of an individual's
alleles that are rare in each simulation.}
\item{\link{alleleFreq}} {--- Calculates the count of each allele in the provided vector.}
\item{\link{calcFE}} {--- Calculates founder equivalents.}
\item{\link{calcFG}} {--- Calculates founder genome equivalents.}
\item{\link{calcFEFG}}{--- Returns founder equivalents \code{FE} and
\code{FG} as elements in a list.}
\item{\link{calcGU}} {--- Calculates genome uniqueness for each ID that is
part of the population.}
\item{\link{geneDrop}} {--- Performs a gene drop simulation based on the
pedigree information.}
\item{\link{chooseAlleles}} {--- Combines two vectors of alleles by randomly
selecting one allele or the other at each position.}
\item{\link{calcRetention}} {--- Calculates allelic retention.}
\item{\link{filterKinMatrix}} {--- Filters a kinship matrix to include only the egos
listed in 'ids'}
\item{\link{kinship}} {--- Generates a kinship matrix}
\item{\link{reportGV}} {--- Generates a genetic value report for a provided pedigree.}
