\title{Performs a gene drop simulation based on the provided pedigree information.}
\usage{
gene.drop(id, sire, dam, gen, n = 5000, updateProgress = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{character vector of IDs for a set of animals.}

\item{sire}{character vector with IDS of the sires for the set of
animals. \code{NA} is used for missing sires.}

\item{dam}{character vector with IDS of the dams for the set of
animals. \code{NA} is used for missing dams.}

\item{gen}{integer vector indicating the generation number for each animal.}

\item{n}{integer indicating the number of iterations to simulate.
Default is 5000.}

\item{updateProgress}{function or NULL. If this function is defined, it
will be called during each iteration to update a
\code{shiny::Progress} object.}
}
\value{
data.frame \code{id, parent, V1 ... Vn}
A data.frame providing the maternal and paternal alleles for an animal
for each iteration. The first two columns provide the animal's ID and
whether the allele came from the sire or dam. These are followed by
\code{n} columns indicating the allele for that iteration.
