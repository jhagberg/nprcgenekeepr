\usage{
calcFEFG(ped, alleles)
}
\arguments{
\item{ped}{the pedigree information in datatable format.  Pedigree
(req. fields: id, sire, dam, gen, population).

It is assumed that the pedigree has no partial parentage}

\item{alleles}{dataframe contains an \code{AlleleTable}. This is a
table of allele information produced by \code{geneDrop()}.}
