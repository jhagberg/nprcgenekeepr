\title{Add animals to an existing breeding or form groups group:}
\usage{
groupAddAssign(candidates, currentGroup = NULL, kmat, ped,
  threshold = 0.015625, ignore = list(c("F", "F")), minAge = 1,
  iter = 1000, numGp = 1, updateProgress = NULL, withKin = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{candidates}{character vector of IDs of the animals available for
use in the group.}

\item{currentGroup}{character vector of IDs of animals currently assigned
to the group. Defaults to NULL assuming no groups are existant.}

\item{kmat}{numeric matrix of pairwise kinship values. Rows and columns
are named with animal IDs.}

\item{ped}{dataframe that is the `Pedigree`. It contains pedigree
information including the IDs listed in \code{candidates}.}

\item{threshold}{numeric value indicating the minimum kinship level to be
considered in group formation. Pairwise kinship below this level will be
ignored.}

\item{ignore}{list of character vectors representing the sex combinations
to be ignored. If provided, the vectors in the list specify if pairwise
kinship should be ignored between certain sexes.
  Default is to ignore all pairwise kinship between females.}

\item{minAge}{integer value indicating the minimum age to consider in group
formation. Pairwise kinships involving an animal of this age or younger will
 be ignored. Default is 1 year.}

\item{iter}{integer indicating the number of times to perform the random
group formation process. Default value is 1000 iterations.}

\item{numGp}{integer value indicating the number of groups that should be
formed from the list of IDs. Default is 1.}

\item{updateProgress}{function or NULL. If this function is defined, it
will be called during each iteration to update a
\code{shiny::Progress} object.}

\item{withKin}{logical variable when set to \code{TRUE} the kinship
matrix for the group is returned along with the group and score.
Defaults to not return the kinship matrix. This maintains compatability with
earlier versions.}
}
\value{
A list with list items \code{group}, \code{score} and optionally
\code{groupKin}.
The list item \code{group} contains a list of the best group(s) produced
during the simulation.
The list item \code{score} provides the score associated with the group(s).
The list item \code{groupKin} contains the subset of the kinship matrix
that is specific for each group formed.
}
\description{
Part of Group Formation
}
\details{
\code{newGroupAddAssign} finds the largest group that can be formed by adding
unrelated animals from a set of candidate IDs to an existing group, to a new
group it has formed from a set of candidate IDs or if more than 1 group
is desired, it finds the set of groups with the largest average size.

The function implements a maximal independent set (MIS) algorithm to find
groups of unrelated animals. A set of animals may have many different MISs of
varying sizes, and finding the largest would require traversing all possible
combinations of animals. Since this could be very time consuming, this
algorithm produces a random sample of the possible MISs, and selects from
these. The size of the random sample is determined by the specified number
of iterations.
