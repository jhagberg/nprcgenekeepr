\title{Get the age distribution for the pedigree}
\usage{
getPyramidAgeDist(ped = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ped}{dataframe with pedigree}
}
\description{
Forms a dataframe with columns \code{id}, \code{birth}, \code{sex},
and {age} for those animals with a status of \code{Alive} in the pedigree.
}
\details{
The lubridate package is used here because of the way the modern Gregorian
calendar is constructed, there is no straightforward arithmetic method
that produces a person’s age, stated according to common usage — common
usage meaning that a person’s age should always be an integer that
increases exactly on a birthday.
