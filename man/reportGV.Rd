\title{Generates a genetic value report for a provided pedigree.}
\usage{
reportGV(ped, gu.iter = 5000, gu.thresh = 1, pop = NULL,
  byID = TRUE, updateProgress = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ped}{the pedigree information in datatable format}

\item{gu.iter}{integer indicating the number of iterations for the gene-drop
analysis. Default is 5000 iterations}

\item{gu.thresh}{integer indicating the threshold number of animals for
defining a unique allele. Default considers an allele "unique"
if it is found in only 1 animal.}

\item{pop}{character vector with animal IDs to consider as the population of
interest. The default is NULL.}

\item{byID}{logical varioable of length 1 that is passed through to
eventually be used by \code{alleleFreq()}, which calculates the count of each
 allele in the provided vector. If \code{byID} is TRUE and ids are provided,
 the function will only count the unique alleles for an individual
  (homozygous alleles will be counted as 1).}

\item{updateProgress}{function or NULL. If this function is defined, it
will be called during each iteration to update a
\code{shiny::Progress} object.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the genetic value report. Animals are ranked
in order of descending value.
}
\description{
This is the main function for the Genetic Value Analysis.
