## Next steps
To be determined


## To do
1. It would be better to catalogue and report the changes made by qcStudbook()
   so that the user knows how the provided pedigree was changed.
2. Amanda Vinson wrote this in an e-mail on 20170901:
  
    I'm very interested in hearing about your idea of adding algorithms related 
    to selecting/maintaining specific alleles in a colony. 
    I think your idea could be related to what I need to work on next, 
    which is an algorithm for assessing the long-term impact on colony genetic 
    diversity of removing specific animals/alleles.  
    This is a need we have here at the ONPRC due to assigning animals to  
    research, and I have been tasked with implementing the solution.

3. Remove individuals that can never breed again from genetic analyses.
(From page 29 of _PMx User Manual, version 1.0_).
It is generally recommended to remove living individuals that can never breed 
or will never be bred again (e.g., post reproductive, sterilized, poor health, 
hybrid) from the genetic mean kinship calculations, as these individuals can no 
longer pass on their genetic material to the next generation and their 
inclusion influences the mean kinship values of other individuals in the 
population. However, these non-reproductive individuals may occupy cage space 
and need to be managed in other ways. In addition, their demographic 
information is valuable. Managers therefore often chose to include these 
individuals in the demographic analysis but to exclude them from genetic 
analysis. 

4. It would be nice to have multiple "selected populations" that could be 
set up and easily selected for various analyses and plots.

5. Talk to Amanda about developing a general way to handle animals without 
two known parents that are not founders. There are the following lines of code
in orderReport.R

    >    \# ONPRC-born animals with no parentage  
    >    i <- (is.na(rpt\$origin) & (rpt\$totalOffspring == 0) & (rpt\$id %in% founders))  
    >    noParentage <- rpt[i, ]  

6. There are some functions that are defined and not used. 
   They may be needed later.
    1. findLoops
    2. makeLoop
    3. countLoops
    4. createPedTree
    
   I expect they are direct ports from kinship2. 
   I will check.
   
7. Find some ways to use genetic marker data in the evaluation of genetic 
   value. This needs to be discussed.
